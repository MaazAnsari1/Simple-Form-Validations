# Simple-Form-Validations
This project is a web application built using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It validates form inputs, ensures all required fields are filled before submission, and displays the submitted data in a dynamic table. Users can edit or delete their entries, and a reset button clears all inputs and errors.
